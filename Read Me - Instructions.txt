Instruction on how to play my game!

1) Launch solution
*** Make sure you are running on x86! for some reason it won't work on x64

2) choose name in console application and press enter

3) when you see the game screen you should see a message "welcome to the dungeon" - Press 'Space'

*** Whenever you see messages pop up, press Space to move on - you will not be able to move or take actions while messages are displayed.

4) arrow keys to move character

5) move to chest/enemy to have an event

6) when in combat:
	a) use up and down arrow keys to switch between 'Fight' and 'Item' buttons
	b) press space to either attack or open item menu

7) when in item menu:
	a) use up and down arrow keys to switch between items
	b) press space to choose an item - if you choose empty item or 'Cancel' nothing will happen

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to KILL ALL THE ENEMIES!! and escape the dungeon.

GOOD LUCK!
